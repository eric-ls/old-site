        <h1>Design meets Programming</h1>
        <p>Web Design Decal is organized into two sections: design and programming. In programming, we teach the necessary technical skills and languages needed to create websites, like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. And in the design section, we teach principles like spacing, typography, and color to help our students craft the best user experience.</p>

        <p>I took the class in Fall 2014, became a TA Spring 2015, and officially started lecturing Fall 2015. Not only do I enjoy designing and coding my own websites, I think web dev is a really useful skill for anyone to learn. Teaching is one of the best ways to improve my own skill, and I knew there would be plenty of bright students to learn from. UC Berkeley's design curriculum isn't the best, and I wanted to help change that.</p>

        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>Team WDD are all committed to one thing: allowing anyone who wants to learn web development to be able to do so. We highly encourage non-cs students to take our decal, and we also broadcast and keep our live lectures - so anyone with an internet connection is able to learn. Our homebrew software, Portal, allows anyone to sign up and access course materials, such as lecture slides, homework, and projects.</p>

        <h1>Lectures for Everyone</h1>
        <p>Because WDD isn't an official course at UC Berkeley, our resources are limited, and unfortunately we can't accept everyone who wants to enroll. Each semester, we take 100 students (from over 800 applications) to ensure a good balance and keep the quality of the course great.</p>

        <p>For Fall 2016, we're (once again) starting WDD Live, where we live stream our weekly lectures. Since we began, we've seen people from all over the world leave us supportive feedback, and it's incredibly humbling and inspiring to see that we're helping so many!</p>
        <p>I'm so grateful to get the opportunity to teach with a group of talented and passionate individuals. Here's to more semesters of WDD!</p>
